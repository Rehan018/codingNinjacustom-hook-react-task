1. **Incorrect Usage of Custom Hooks:**
   - Issue: The components were importing `getLanguageValue` and `getThemeValue` functions, which were not exported from their respective context files. This resulted in import errors.
   - Solution: Corrected the imports in the components and used the custom hooks (`useLanguage` and `useTheme`) directly instead of the functions.

2. **Missing JSX Content in Context Providers:**
   - Issue: The context providers (`LanguageContextProvider` and `ThemeContextProvider`) were not returning any JSX content, which is required to wrap their children with the context providers.
   - Solution: Updated the context providers to wrap their children with the context providers and pass the context values through the `value` prop.

3. **Correcting Component Usage of Context Values:**
   - Issue: The components were not correctly accessing the context values using the custom hooks. Instead, they were trying to use functions that were not exported.
   - Solution: Updated the component files (`Navbar.js`, `App.js`, and `Home.js`) to import and use the custom hooks (`useLanguage` and `useTheme`) directly.

By addressing these issues, we ensured that the components could properly access the context values using custom hooks, which resolved the rendering issues and made the custom hooks work as expected.
